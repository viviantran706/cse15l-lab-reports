## Part 3

From week 2 and 3, I have learned how a method that have the same out come has different bugs. 
For exmaple when looking at the reverseInplace method, when debugging there wa a few errors 
but if we looked at reversed method we see that the both have the same intentions, but each
had there own errors and bugs that were different. Another thing that I learned form these 
week was how to write tester cases. Beucase I have never wrote tester before with JUmit. So this
week was really useful.
